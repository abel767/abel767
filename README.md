👋 Hi, I'm **Abel Thomas**!

**Certified SOC Analyst (CSA/CICSA) | Threat Detection & Incident Response Specialist**

I am a cybersecurity professional dedicated to **detecting, analyzing, and mitigating** digital threats. My expertise stems from deep training in **SOC analysis** and IT infrastructure security, allowing me to provide robust defense against modern attack vectors.

**My development background (MERN) provides a unique advantage in understanding the attacker's perspective and the inner workings of web applications.**

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Core Competencies

* **SOC Operations:** Proficient in log analysis, security monitoring, and using **SIEM** tools to triage and investigate high-fidelity security alerts.
* **Incident Response:** Skilled in containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis following established IR frameworks.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Identifying security weaknesses across systems and applications, with hands-on knowledge of common web vulnerabilities (**OWASP Top 10**).
* **Infrastructure Security:** Expertise in securing OS (Linux/Windows), network components, and ensuring security best practices at the infrastructure layer (CICSA training).

### 💻 Development Context (Where I Apply Security)

* **Focus Area:** Applying security principles to web environments built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
* **Secure Code Review:** Identifying and suggesting fixes for vulnerabilities found in application code.

### 🌟 Goal

My goal is to transition practical threat knowledge into actionable defense strategies, fortifying digital assets from the endpoint to the application layer.
